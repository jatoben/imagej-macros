# imagej-macros
Macros to assist with output of trait measurements, making data easier to work with.

The main benefit to this macro is that the ouput contains the file name to avoid naming errors. You can name your photos with individual IDs and those IDs will be linked to the trait measurements in the output.

#Linear measurements
This macro allows you to measure up to 10 linear (or segmented) traits. Use the number keys to denote the traits. The output will give the file name, followed by the ten lengths. If you only meaure three traits, the other seven traits will show as -1. The negative ones can then be removed from the data once it is copied to a spreadsheet.
